![download the repo as a zip](images/downloadzip.png)

2. Run:

```terminal
chmod u+x auto.sh
./auto.sh "<path of your google drive folder>"
```

To get the path of your Google Drive folder, new Terminal (or Command Prompt,...) in the Google Drive folder and run: `pwd`. This will print the path to the screen.

Usually, the path will contain space: My Drive, so you need to quote the path.
